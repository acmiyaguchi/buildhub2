## Overview

Every time [Taskcluster](https://tools.taskcluster.net/) builds a version of
Firefox, Fennec, etc. the built files are put into an S3 bucket. One of the files
that is always accompanied is a file called `buildhub.json` that we download,
validate an index into a PostgreSQL database as well as Elasticsearch.

The way we consume these is that every S3 write triggers its key into an SQS queue
which we consume with a daemon script.

The UI is a static single-page-app that helps you make Elasticsearch queries.

## First Principles
